ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Data Analysis â€“ EDA Case Study with Python
A Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) project that uncovers trends in Netflix's content library using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

In this project, I analyzed Netflix's dataset to understand how its library has evolved over time. Using Pandas for data cleaning and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization, I explored trends like the dominance of Movies over TV Shows, top genres (Drama & Comedy), most common ratings (TV-MA, TV-14), and rising content contributions from countries like India.

ðŸ“Š What I Did:

Cleaned and standardized the dataset (nulls, text formats, type conversions)

Used descriptive statistics to summarize key fields like duration, ratings, and release year

Applied Seaborn & Matplotlib to visualize:

Content type distribution

Top genres

Ratings and duration patterns

Country-wise contributions

Trends in content additions over time

Conducted basic time series and correlation analysis to observe platform growth and genre timing

The project helped visualize how Netflix has grown yearly and what type of content it prioritizes â€” offering insights into platform strategy through data.
